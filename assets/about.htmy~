    <br>
    Back in those days of engineering, while we were still young, carefree and innocent, the vague outlines of our group had begun to form.
    While we did spend most of our time together, there was still no common interest binding us together. From bears to monkeys, owls to cranes,
    guns and generals, villagers, jasmines and what not, each one had a free reign and a dream for the group.
    <br></br>
    Then came the rule of the Sun God. For fifty days, he held our collective interests ranging from a few minutes each day to hours on end.
    The simple reason behind it were rebuses...
    <br></br>
    Time flew, we graduated and took our separate ways. Bound together online. And then, suddenly, out of nowhere, we were at it again.
    A gentle push and we were creating hundreds of rebuses and building a database.
    <br><br>
    We are now featured in "The Hindu in School", providing them with a rebus a day. Considering the fact that it is reaching school children,
    we can safely presume that we have done our bit towards enhancing lateral thinking among those budding talents out to secure their future.
    <br><br>
    Build ups apart, we realised it is high time to get ourselves online and set out with this blog which you are viewing at the moment.
    We'd love to keep this going as long as we can, provided we have those faithful followers. Now, and forever...
